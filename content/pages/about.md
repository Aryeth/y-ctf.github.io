The Y-CTF club is a nonprofit student association founded in 2019 at HEIG-VD.  

Its goal is to promote and introduce cybersecurity to the school's students.  

The club's main activity is participating in CTF events in French-speaking Switzerland (such as Insomniâ€™hack and Black Alps) as well as regularly taking part in online CTFs. Throughout the year, depending on the availability of members and the committee, we also organize presentations on various ethical hacking topics, workshops, and CTF training sessions.
